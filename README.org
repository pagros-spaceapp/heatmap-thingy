    *why super res*
    - so we needa kinda compare image simliarity
    - the best way to do this is to somehow rate 2 imgs at the same time
    - intuitively there will be some kinda of loss fn with the 2 imgs as input
    - then i thought about all the different cases where you have to ensure img looks similar
    - so there are 2 examples i thought springs to mind
        - face generation GAN (deepfake) -> loss function to measure img structure simliarity
        - super res -> compare img 2 img simliarity
    - the loss fn used in face generation GAN might not be sufficient
        - only measures difference in features
    - so i picked super resolution instead, i went online to search for the survey paper
        - so most of my loss fns i obtain from here
    - final goal is to come up with a score that measures 2 images

* task
** TODO find common overlapping area in tiff files
